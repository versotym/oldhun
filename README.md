## Replication code for Maróthy, Seláf, Plecháč: Rhyming in Sixteenth-Century Hungarian Historical Songs: A Pilot Study

**src** directory contains raw texts in txt.

In order to rebuild the corpus run **01_build_corpus.py, 02_morphology.py, 03_rhymes.py**, respectively. This will produce annotated corpus (**json** directory).

To reproduce the figures run **04_plots.py**, which will produce a bunch of pdf files (**fig** directory). 

**listofpoems.csv** contains basic metadata of the analyzed poems.
